Samples were borrowed from [this repository](https://github.com/voxserv/audio_quality_testing_samples) and [this site](https://helpguide.sony.net/high-res/sample1/v1/en/index.html). Then downsampled using SOXR library with the highest quality option, then upsampled. Resulting files are used to test the accuracy of the current library.

Scripts used for sine generation and other tests can be found in [this](https://gitlab.com/Gunter-Q12/resample_tests) repository.

Benchmark samples are just some random sounds, input data does not matter in this case.
